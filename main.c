/*
This example should run on most AVRs with only little changes. No special
hardware resources except INT0 are used. You may have to change usbconfig.h for
different I/O pins for USB. Please note that USB D+ must be the INT0 pin, or
at least be connected to INT0 as well.

We use VID/PID 0x046D/0xC00E which is taken from a Logitech mouse. Don't
publish any hardware using these IDs! This is for demonstration only!
